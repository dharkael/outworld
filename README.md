An app for learning [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor), and [Requery](https://github.com/requery/requery)

 I'm learning to use all three at the same time, based around  [OCtranspo's Open Data](http://www.octranspo.com/developers).
 I have no specific plans, but I have vague notions about building some sort of travel planner app with the available data.

 WIP
